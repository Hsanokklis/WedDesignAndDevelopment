# $${\color{purple}Welcome \space to \space  my \space  Web \space  Design \space and \space Development \space  Repo!}$$

### I took a web design class in high school, and really enjoyed it! As I have started college I have had not had much time to refine my web design/dev skills, so this repo will house my practice! My intent is to make this wiki a dictionary so if I forget how do something I can easily reference it here!

## I will be following along with CodeHS Tutorials that can be found on Youtube [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsw0rAQOqos&list=PLUEYQSaHI9SK6P6LaBOVtK0POhFu5GDKR) 

## You can find notes on the tutorials, and how-tos within the [Wiki](https://github.com/Hsanokklis/WedDesignAndDevelopment/wiki) in this repo!
